This repository will help you master neural networks.  It contains writeups of how different neural networks work, along with full implementations of different network types.

- The `explanations` folder has writeups of each algorithm.
- The `nnets` folder has clean implementations that are best for someone who understands the high level concept.
- The `exploration` folder has implementations that are more exploratory and easier to understand for beginners.

I recommend reading the writeup, then looking at the exploratory implementation, then looking at the clean implementation.

## 1. Linear regression

Linear regression and gradient descent are important building blocks for neural networks.

- [Linear regression tutorial](explanations/linreg.ipynb)
- [Clean implementation](nnets/linreg.py)
- [Notebook implementation](exploration/linreg/linreg.ipynb)

## 2. Dense networks

Dense networks are networks where every input is connected to an output.

- [Clean implementation](nnets/dense.py)
- [Notebook implementation](exploration/dense/dense.ipynb)

## 3. Convolutional networks

Convolutional neural networks are used for working with images and time series.

- [Clean implementation](nnets/conv.py)
- [Notebook implementation](exploration/cnn/cnn.ipynb)
